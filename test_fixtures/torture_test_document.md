# Heading 1 {#h1-id .h1-class key="value"}

This is a paragraph under H1. It contains some *italic* and **bold** text.
It also includes a [link to AIDE](https://aide.aide.com). And an image: ![Aide Logo](https://aide.aide.com/logo.png)

## Heading 2 with `code` {#h2-id}

This paragraph has inline `code`.

::: {#semantic-div-1 .theorem type="Pythagorean"}
This is a semantic block, styled as a theorem.
It might contain **strong emphasis** and equations like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
This div has an ID and a class.
:::

Another paragraph here, following the semantic block.

### Heading 3 {#h3-id}

*   Unordered list item 1
*   Unordered list item 2
    *   Nested unordered list item 2.1
    *   Nested unordered list item 2.2

1.  Ordered list item 1
2.  Ordered list item 2
    1.  Nested ordered list item 2.1
    2.  Nested ordered list item 2.2
3.  Ordered list item 3

```python
# This is a Python code block
def greet(name):
  """Greets the user."""
  print(f"Hello, {name}!")

greet("World")
```

This is a paragraph with a footnote.[^1]

## LaTeX Math Equations {#math-section}

Inline math: $E = mc^2$. This equation $\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i = x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_n$ is also inline.

Display math:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

Another display equation:
\[
\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a}
\]

### LaTeX Environments

A common LaTeX environment:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lorentz}
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}}
\end{equation}
We can refer to this equation using `\cref{eq:lorentz}`.

Another one:
\begin{align} \label{eq:maxwell}
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} &= 0 \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} &= -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} \\
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} &= \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{J} + \epsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right)
\end{align}
We can refer to Maxwell's equations using `\cref{eq:maxwell}`.

This is a reference to a non-existent label: `\cref{eq:nonexistent}`.

::: {#semantic-div-2 .nested-container data-level="outer"}
This is an outer semantic block.
It can contain other blocks, including other semantic blocks or normal paragraphs.

This is a paragraph inside the outer semantic block.

::: {#nested-div .definition data-type="mathematical"}
This is a nested semantic block (a definition).
Content within the nested block.
It has its own ID and class.
:::

A paragraph following the nested div, but still inside the outer div.
:::

::: {.callout .callout-warning}
**Warning:** This is a callout box with warning styling.
It demonstrates how fenced divs can be used for special content blocks.
:::

::: {.code-example lang="python"}
```python
# This code is inside a fenced div
def example_function():
    return "Hello from fenced div!"
```
:::

::: {#proof-block .proof .theorem data-number="1.1"}
**Proof of Concept:** This div shows how academic content can be structured.

*Given:* Some mathematical statement
*To Prove:* The statement is true
*Proof:* By construction... âˆŽ
:::

::: custom-class another-class="value" data-custom="attribute"
This div tests multiple classes and custom attributes.
It should parse correctly and preserve all metadata.
:::

A final paragraph to conclude the document.
This includes a `\label{final-label}` here.
And a reference `\cref{final-label}`.

### Potentially Malformed Block (for testing resilience)

::: {.warning}
This block has an unclosed backtick `
and maybe some other weirdness.
