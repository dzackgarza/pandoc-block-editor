# üßÆ Pandoc Block Editor
## Specialized Amsthm Environment Editor with Perfect Alignment

A **specialized PyQt6 editor** focused exclusively on **fenced div blocks** for mathematical environments like theorems, definitions, proofs, etc. Each block on the left is **perfectly top-aligned** with its rendered counterpart on the right.

## ‚ú® What You Asked For

### ‚úÖ **Fenced Divs Only**
- Focused solely on `:::` fenced div blocks
- No general markdown - just mathematical environments
- Clean, minimal interface for mathematical writing

### ‚úÖ **Perfect Alignment**
- Each editor block aligns precisely with its preview
- Top alignment between left and right panes
- No scrolling mismatches or layout drift

### ‚úÖ **Amsthm Environments**
Your exact syntax:
```markdown
:::{.theorem title="theorem name"}
Text here
:::
```

Renders as beautifully styled mathematical environment blocks!

- **Environment attributes** (`{.theorem title="..."}`) in emerald
- **Math expressions** (`$...$`, `$$...$$`) with red highlighting and backgrounds
- **Content text** in clean gray

### **Perfect Block Alignment**
- Left editor blocks align with right preview blocks
- No height restrictions - blocks size to content
- Synchronized scrolling between panes
- Visual block IDs for easy identification

### **Professional Math Rendering**
- **MathJax** for beautiful equation rendering

- **Native menus**: File operations, environment insertion
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Ctrl+N, Ctrl+O, Ctrl+S
- **Toolbar buttons**: Quick access to add theorem, definition, proof
- **Environment menu**: Add any supported environment type
- **Auto-sizing**: Blocks grow/shrink with content

## üìù Usage Examples

### **Theorem with Title**
```markdown
:::{.theorem title="Pythagorean Theorem"}
In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides.

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
:::
```

### **Definition**
```markdown
:::{.definition title="Vector Space"}
A **vector space** over a field $F$ is a set $V$ equipped with operations of addition and scalar multiplication satisfying:

1. Associativity of addition
2. Commutativity of addition  
3. Identity element of addition
4. Existence of additive inverses
:::
```

### **Proof**
```markdown
:::{.proof}
Let $ABC$ be a right triangle with right angle at $C$. Then by the law of cosines:

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos(C)$$

Since $C = 90¬∞$, we have $\cos(C) = 0$, so:

$$c^2 = a^2 + b^2$$
:::
```

## üéØ Perfect for Mathematical Writing

### **What Makes This Special**
- **Zero height restrictions** - blocks fit content perfectly
- **Mathematical focus** - designed specifically for theorem-proof writing
- **Beautiful rendering** - LaTeX-quality output in real-time
- **Aligned editing** - see your content positioned exactly as it will appear
- **Distraction-free** - no general markdown clutter

### **Ideal Workflow**
1. **Add environments** using toolbar buttons or Environment menu
2. **Type directly** in fenced div syntax with syntax highlighting
3. **See immediate preview** with perfect alignment
4. **Math renders beautifully** with MathJax
5. **Save as markdown** for use with Pandoc, LaTeX, etc.

## üìÅ File Operations

### **Open Existing Files**
- Parses fenced divs from any markdown file
- Ignores non-fenced-div content (focuses on what you need)
- Maintains environment types and titles

### **Save Files**
- Exports clean markdown with proper fenced div syntax
- Compatible with Pandoc and LaTeX
- Ready for academic publishing workflows

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |

- **QSyntaxHighlighter** for custom fenced div highlighting
- **QWebEngineView** for beautiful HTML preview
- **Your existing pandoc_utils** for markdown processing
- **MathJax** for mathematical typesetting

### **Architecture**
- `FencedDivBlock` - Data model for each environment
- `FencedDivEditor` - Syntax-highlighted editor widget
- `FencedDivContainer` - Aligned block container
- `AmsthmPreviewPane` - Mathematical preview renderer
- `AmsthmEditor` - Main application window

### **Perfect Alignment Implementation**

## üéì Sample Output

When you write:
```markdown
:::{.theorem title="Fundamental Theorem of Calculus"}
If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ and $F$ is an antiderivative of $f$, then:

$$\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = F(b) - F(a)$$
:::
```

You get a **beautifully rendered theorem block** with:
- Blue left border
- Gradient background  
- "**Theorem (Fundamental Theorem of Calculus)**" header
- Perfectly typeset mathematics
- Professional LaTeX-style appearance
