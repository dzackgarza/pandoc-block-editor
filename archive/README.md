## Why Archived

These components were replaced by the focused **amsthm environment editor** which:
- Eliminates complexity by focusing only on fenced div blocks
- Provides perfect alignment between editor and preview
- Specializes in mathematical environment rendering
- Removes all height restrictions and web-based limitations

## Current Application

The current application (in the parent directory) is the **specialized amsthm environment editor** built with PyQt6, focused exclusively on mathematical fenced div environments with perfect alignment.

To use the current version:
```bash
cd ..
python test.py              # Run all tests
python tests/test_editor.py # Test editor functionality only  
python run.py               # Launch the editor
```

## Historical Context

The evolution was:
1. **Streamlit version** - Web-based but with 68px height restrictions
2. **General PyQt6 version** - Native desktop but still general-purpose  
3. **Specialized amsthm version** - Focused, minimal, perfect alignment âœ…

The final specialized version achieves exactly what was requested: fenced div blocks only, with perfect top-alignment between editor and preview.
